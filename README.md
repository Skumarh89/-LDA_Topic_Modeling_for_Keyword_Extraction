# LDA_Topic_Modeling_for_Keyword_Extraction

This project aims to build a text analysis tool that performs the following tasks:


    1. Reads user input dynamically to process text passages or paragraphs.
    2. Identifies the most informative line from the user input.
    3. Uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to extract relevant keywords from the selected line.




    
How to Use


    1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
    2. Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    3. Run the Python script (main.py or any other filename) and provide the text passage when prompted.
    4. The script will perform LDA topic modeling and display the extracted keywords with their probability scores.
    5. The results will also be saved in a CSV file named lda_results.csv in the same directory.
